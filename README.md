# Merge-and-Insertion-Sort

For both the submitted codes, the program will ask the about the limit on how many
it will sort and depending on the user the program will ask to run another test.
once the user is finished with running test with the given sorting method a graph
would be made to show the results of the test that was run.

Both sorting methods can sort almost all of the given limits but the insertion
method struggles with more intergers to work with, whereas the merge method can function
for a bit longer.
